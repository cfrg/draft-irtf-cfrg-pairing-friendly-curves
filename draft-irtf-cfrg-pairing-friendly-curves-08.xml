        <t>Elliptic curve cryptography is an important area in currently deployed cryptography. The cryptographic algorithms based on elliptic curve cryptography, such as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), are widely used in many applications.</t>
        <t>Pairing-based cryptography, a subfield of elliptic curve cryptography, has attracted much attention due to its flexible and practical functionality.
Pairings are special maps defined using elliptic curves.
Pairings are fundamental in the construction of several cryptographic algorithms and protocols such as identity-based encryption (IBE), attribute-based encryption (ABE), authenticated key exchange (AKE), short signatures, and so on. Several applications of pairing-based cryptography are currently in practical use.</t>
        <t>As the importance of pairings grows, elliptic curves where pairings are efficiently computable are studied and the special curves called pairing-friendly curves are proposed.</t>

      <section anchor="applications-of-pairing-based-cryptography" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Applications of Pairing-based Cryptography</name>
        <t>Several applications using pairing-based cryptography have already been standardized and deployed. We list here some examples of applications available in the real world.</t>
        <t>IETF published RFCs for pairing-based cryptography such as Identity-Based Cryptography <xref target="RFC5091" format="default"/>, Sakai-Kasahara Key Encryption (SAKKE) <xref target="RFC6508" format="default"/>, and Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange (IBAKE) <xref target="RFC6539" format="default"/>. 
SAKKE is applied to Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) <xref target="RFC6509" format="default"/> and used in 3GPP <xref target="SAKKE" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>Pairing-based key agreement protocols are standardized in ISO/IEC <xref target="ISOIEC11770-3" format="default"/>.
In <xref target="ISOIEC11770-3" format="default"/>, a key agreement scheme by Joux <xref target="Joux00" format="default"/>, identity-based key agreement schemes by Smart-Chen-Cheng <xref target="CCS07" format="default"/> and Fujioka-Suzuki-Ustaoglu <xref target="FSU10" format="default"/> are specified.</t>
        <t>MIRACL implements M-Pin, a multi-factor authentication protocol <xref target="M-Pin" format="default"/>.
The M-Pin protocol includes a type of zero-knowledge proof, where pairings are used for its construction.</t>
        <t>The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) specified the Elliptic Curve Direct Anonymous Attestation (ECDAA) in the specification of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) <xref target="TPM" format="default"/>. 
ECDAA is a protocol for proving the attestation held by a TPM to a verifier without revealing the attestation held by that TPM. Pairings are used in the construction of ECDAA. FIDO Alliance <xref target="FIDO" format="default"/> and W3C <xref target="W3C" format="default"/> also published an ECDAA algorithm similar to TCG.</t>

<t>Intel introduced Intel Enhanced Privacy ID (EPID) that enables remote attestation of a hardware device while preserving the privacy of the device as part of the functionality of Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) <xref target="EPID" format="default"/>. They extended TPM ECDAA to realize such functionality. A pairing-based EPID was proposed <xref target="BL10" format="default"/> and distributed along with Intel SGX applications.</t>

<t>Zcash implemented their own zero-knowledge proof algorithm named Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) <xref target="Zcash" format="default"/>. zk-SNARKs are used for protecting the privacy of transactions of Zcash. They use pairings to construct zk-SNARKs.</t>
<t>Cloudflare introduced Geo Key Manager <xref target="Cloudflare" format="default"/> to restrict distribution of customers' private keys to a subset of their data centers. To achieve this functionality, ABE is used, and pairings take a role as a building block. In addition, Cloudflare published a new cryptographic library, the Cloudflare Interoperable, Reusable Cryptographic Library (CIRCL) <xref target="CIRCL" format="default"/> in 2019. They plan to include securely implemented subroutines for pairing computations on certain secure pairing-friendly curves in CIRCL.</t>
        <t>Currently, Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signature schemes are being standardized 
<xref target="I-D.boneh-bls-signature" format="default"/> and utilized in several blockchain projects 
such as Ethereum <xref target="Ethereum" format="default"/>, Algorand <xref target="Algorand" format="default"/>, Chia Network <xref target="Chia" format="default"/>, and DFINITY <xref target="DFINITY" format="default"/>. 
The aggregation functionality of BLS signatures is effective for their applications of decentralization and scalability.</t>

        <name>Motivation and Contribution</name>
<t> At CRYPTO 2016, Kim and Barbulescu proposed an efficient number field sieve (NFS) algorithm for the discrete logarithm problem in a finite field <xref target="KB16" format="default"/>. Several types of pairing-friendly curves such as Barreto-Naehrig curves (BN curves)<xref target="BN05" format="default"/> and Barreto-Lynn-Scott curves (BLS curves)<xref target="BLS02" format="default"/> are affected by the attack, since a pairing-friendly curve suitable for cryptographic applications requires that the discrete logarithm problem is sufficiently difficult. In particular, BN254, which is a BN curve with a 254-bit characteristic effective for pairing calculations, was adopted by a lot of cryptographic libraries as a parameter of the 128-bit security level, however, BN254 ensures no more than the 100-bit security level due to the effect of the attack, where the security levels described in this memo correspond to the security strength of NIST recommendation <xref target="NIST" format="default"/>.
</t>

<t>To resolve this effect immediately, several research groups and implementers re-evaluated the security of pairing-friendly curves and they respectively proposed various curves that are secure against the attack <xref target="BD18" format="default"/> <xref target="BLS12-381" format="default"/>.</t>

<t>In this memo, we list the security levels of certain pairing-friendly curves, and motivate our choices of curves. First, we summarize the adoption status of pairing-friendly curves in international standards, libraries and applications, and classify them in the 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit security levels. Then, from the viewpoints of "security" and "widely used", pairing-friendly curves corresponding to each security level are selected in accordance with the security evaluation by Barbulescu and Duquesne <xref target="BD18" format="default"/>. </t> 

<t> As a result, we recommend the BLS curve with 381-bit characteristic of embedding degree 12 and the BN curve with the 462-bit characteristic for the 128-bit security level, and the BLS curves of embedding degree 48 with the 581-bit characteristic for the 256-bit security level. This memo shows their specific test vectors.</t>

        <name>Elliptic Curves</name>
        <t>Let p be a prime number and q = p^n for a natural number n, where at least 5.
Let F_q be a finite field.
The curve defined by the following equation E is called an elliptic curve: </t>
        <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[
   E : y^2 = x^3 + a * x + b,
]]></artwork>
        <t> and a and b in F_q satisfy the discriminant inequality 4 * a^3 + 27 * b^2 != 0 mod q.
This is called the Weierstrass normal form of an elliptic curve.</t>
<t>A solution (x,y) to the equation E can be thought of as a point on the corresponding curve. For a natural number k, we define the set of (F_q^k)-rational points of E, denoted by E(F_q^k), to be the set of all solutions (x,y) in F_q^k, together with a 'point at infinity' O_E, which is defined to lie on every vertical line passing through the curve E.</t>
<t>The set E(F_q^k) forms a group under a group law that can be defined geometrically as follows. For P and Q in E(F_q^k) define P + Q to be the reflection around the x-axis of the unique third point R of intersection of the straight line passing through P and Q with the curve E. If the straight line is tangent to E, we say that it passes through that point twice. The identity of this group is the point at infinity O_E. We also define scalar multiplication [K]P for a positive integer K as the point P added to itself (K-1) times. Here, [0]P becomes the point at infinity O_E and the relation [-K]P = -([K]P) is satisfied. </t>
<t>We define some of the terminology used in this memo as follows:</t>

        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
          <dt>b:</dt>
          <dd>

        <name>Pairings</name>
        <t>A pairing is a bilinear map defined on two subgroups of rational points of an elliptic curve. Examples include the Weil pairing, the Tate pairing, the optimal Ate pairing <xref target="Ver09" format="default"/>, and so on.
The optimal Ate pairing is considered to be the most efficient to compute and is the one that is most commonly used for practical implementation.</t>

<t>Let E be an elliptic curve defined over a prime field F_p. Let k be the minimum integer for which r is a divisor of p^k - 1; this is called the embedding degree of E over F_p. Let G_1 be a cyclic subgroup of E(F_p) of order r, there also exists a cyclic subgroup of E(F_p^k) of order r, define this to be G_2. It can sometimes be convenient for efficiency to do the computations of G_2 in the twist E', and so consider G_2 to instead be a subgroup of E'. Let G_T be an order r subgroup of the multiplicative group (F_p^k)^*; this exists by definition of k.</t>
        <t>A pairing is defined as a bilinear map e: (G_1, G_2) -&gt; G_T
satisfying the following properties:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
          <li>Bilinearity: for any S in G_1, T in G_2, and integers K and L, e([K]S, [L]T) = e(S, T)^{K * L}.</li>
          <li>Non-degeneracy: for any T in G_2, e(S, T) = 1 if and only if S = O_E.
 Similarly, for any S in G_1, e(S, T) = 1 if and only if T = O_E.</li>
        </ol>
      <t>In applications, it is also necessary that for any S in G_1 and T in G_2, this bilinear map is efficiently computable.</t>

        <name>Barreto-Naehrig Curves</name>
        <t>A BN curve <xref target="BN05" format="default"/> is a family of pairing-friendly curves proposed in 2005. A pairing over BN curves constructs optimal Ate pairings.</t>
        <t>A BN curve is defined by elliptic curves E and E' parameterized by a well-chosen integer t.
E is defined over F_p, where p is a prime number and at least 5, and E(F_p) has a subgroup of prime order r.
The characteristic p and the order r are parameterized by</t>
        <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[
    p = 36 * t^4 + 36 * t^3 + 24 * t^2 + 6 * t + 1
    r = 36 * t^4 + 36 * t^3 + 18 * t^2 + 6 * t + 1
]]></artwork>
        <t>for an integer t.</t>
        <t>The elliptic curve E has an equation of the form E: y^2 = x^3 + b, where b is a primitive element of the multiplicative group (F_p)^* of order (p - 1).</t>
        <t>In the case of BN curves, we can use twists of the degree 6. If m is an element that is neither a square nor a cube in an extension field F_p^2, the twist E' of E is defined over an extension field F_p^2 by the equation E': y^2 = x^3 + b' with b' = b / m or b' = b * m. 
BN curves are called D-type if b' = b / m, and M-type if b' = b * m.
The embedding degree k is 12.</t>
        <t>A pairing e is defined by taking G_1 as a subgroup of E(F_p) of order r, G_2 as a subgroup of E'(F_p^2), and G_T as a subgroup of a multiplicative group (F_p^12)^* of order r.</t>

        <t>A BLS curve <xref target="BLS02" format="default"/> is a another family of pairing-frinedly curves proposed in 2002. Similar to BN curves, a pairing over BLS curves constructs optimal Ate pairings.</t>
        <t>A BLS curve is defined by elliptic curves E and E' parameterized by a well-chosen integer t.
E is defined over a finite field F_p by an equation of the form E: y^2 = x^3 + b,
and its twist E': y^2 = x^3 + b', is defined in the same way as BN curves. 
In contrast to BN curves, E(F_p) does not have a prime order.
Instead, its order is divisible by a large parameterized prime r and denoted by h * r with cofactor h.
The pairing is defined on the r-torsion points.
In the same way as BN curves, BLS curves can be categorized as D-type and M-type.</t>
        <t>BLS curves vary in accordance with different embedding degrees. In this memo, we deal with the BLS12 and BLS48 families with embedding degrees 12 and 48 with respect to r, respectively.</t>
        <t>In BLS curves, parameters p and r are given by the following equations:</t>

   BLS48:

        <name>Representation Convention for an Extension Field</name>
        <t>Pairing-friendly curves use a tower of some extension fields. 
In order to encode an element of an extension field, focusing on interoperability, we adopt the representation convention shown in Appendix J.4 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-lwig-curve-representations" format="default"/> as a standard and effective method.</t>
        <t>Let F_p be a finite field of characteristic p and F_p^d = F_p(i) be an extension field of F_p of degree d.</t>
        <t>
    For an element s in F_p^d such that s = s_0 + s_1 * i + ... + s_{d - 1} *&nbsp;&nbsp;i^{d - 1} where s_0, s_1, ... , s_{d - 1} in the basefield F_p, s is represented as octet string by oct(s) = s_0 || s_1 || ... || s_{d - 1}.
</t>
        <t>Let F_p^d' = F_p^d(j) be an extension field of F_p^d of degree d' / d.</t>
        <t>
    For an element s' in F_p^d' such that s' = s'_0 + s'_1 * j + ... + s'_{d' / d - 1} * j^{d' / d - 1} where s'_0, s'_1, ..., s'_{d' / d - 1} in the basefield F_p^d, s' is represented as integer by oct(s') = oct(s'_0) || oct(s'_1) || ... || oct(s'_{d' / d - 1}), where oct(s'_0), ... , oct(s'_{d' / d - 1}) are octet strings encoded by above convention.
</t>
        <t>In general, one can define encoding between integer and an element of any finite field tower by inductively applying the above convention.</t>
        <t>The parameters and test vectors of extension fields described in this memo are encoded by this convention and represented in an octet stream.</t>
<t>
When applications communicate elements in an extension field, using the compression method <xref target="MP04" format="default"/> may be more effective. 
In that case, care for interoperability must be taken.

        <name>Evaluating the Security of Pairing-Friendly Curves</name>
        <t>The security of pairing-friendly curves is evaluated by the hardness of the following discrete logarithm problems: </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) in G_1 and G_2</li>
          <li>The finite field discrete logarithm problem (FFDLP) in G_T</li>
        </ul>
        <t>There are other hard problems over pairing-friendly curves used for proving the security of pairing-based cryptography. Such problems include the computational bilinear Diffie-Hellman (CBDH) problem, the bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) problem, the decision bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) problem, the gap DBDH problem, etc. <xref target="ECRYPT" format="default"/>.
Almost all of these variants are reduced to the hardness of discrete logarithm problems described above and are believed to be easier than the discrete logarithm problems.</t>
        <t>Although it would be sufficient to attack any of these problems to attack pairing-based crytography, the only known attacks thus far attack the discrete logarithm problem directly, so we focus on the discrete logarithm in this memo.</t>
        <t>The security levels of pairing-friendly curves are estimated by the computational cost of the most efficient algorithm for solving the above discrete logarithm problems. The best-known algorithms for solving the discrete logarithm problems are based on Pollard's rho algorithm <xref target="Pollard78" format="default"/> and Index Calculus <xref target="HR83" format="default"/>. 
        To make index calculus algorithms more efficient, number field sieve (NFS) algorithms are utilized.</t>

        <name>Impact of Recent Attacks</name>
        <t>In 2016, Kim and Barbulescu proposed a new variant of the NFS algorithms, the extended tower number field sieve (exTNFS), which drastically reduces the complexity of solving FFDLP <xref target="KB16" format="default"/>.
Due to exTNFS, the security levels of certain pairing-friendly curves asymptotically dropped down.
For instance, Barbulescu and Duquesne estimated that the security of the BN curves, which had been believed to provide 128-bit security (BN256, for example) was reduced to approximately 100 bits <xref target="BD18" format="default"/>. Here, the security levels described in this memo correspond to the security strength of NIST recommendation <xref target="NIST" format="default"/>.
</t>
        <t>There has since been research into the minimum bit length of the parameters of pairing-friendly curves for each security level when applying exTNFS as an attacking method for FFDLP.
For 128-bit security, Barbulescu and Duquesne estimated the minimum bit length of p of BN curves and BLS12 curves after exTNFS as 461 bits <xref target="BD18" format="default"/>.
For 256-bit security, Kiyomura et al. estimated the minimum bit length of p^k of BLS48 curves as 27,410 bits, which indicated 572 bits of p <xref target="KIK17" format="default"/>.</t>

In our selection policy, it is important that selected curves are shown in peer-reviewed papers for security and that they are widely used in cryptographic libraries.

The curves categorized as 'Arnd 128-bit', 'Arnd 192-bit' and 'Arnd 256-bit' for each label show that their security levels are within the range of plus/minus 5 bits for each security level. Other labels shown with '~' mean that the security level of the categorized curve is outside the range of each security level. Specifically, the security level of the categorized curves is more than the previous column and is less than the next column.
The details are described as the following subsections. A BN curve with a XXX-bit characteristic p is denoted as BNXXX and a BLS curve of embedding degree k with a XXX-bit p is denoted as BLSk_XXX.
Due to space limitations, <xref target="adoption" format="default"/> omits libraries that have not been maintained since the 2016 exTNFS attacks and curves that have had the security levels below 128 bits since before 2016 (ex. BN160). The full version of <xref target="adoption" format="default"/> is available at <eref target="https://lepidum.co.jp/blog/2020-03-27/ietf-draft-pfc/" brackets="none"/>. In this table, the security level for each curve is evaluated in accordance with <xref target="BD18" format="default"/>,<xref target="GMT19" format="default"/>, <xref target="MAF19" format="default"/> and <xref target="FK18" format="default"/>. Note that the Freeman curves and MNT curves are not included in this table because <xref target="BD18" format="default"/> does not show the security levels of these curves.

<xref target="adoption" format="default"/> shows a lot of cases of adopting BN and BLS curves. Among them, BLS12_381 and BN462 match our selection policy.
Especially, the one that best matches the policy is BLS12_381 from the viewpoint of "widely used" and "efficiency", so we introduce the parameters of BLS12_381 in this memo. 
</t>
<t>
On the other hand, from the viewpoint of the future use, the parameter of BN462 is also introduced. 
As shown in recent security evaluations for BLS12_381<xref target="BD18" format="default"/> <xref target="GMT19" format="default"/>, its security level close to 128-bit but it is less than 128-bit.
If the attack is improved even a little, BLS12_381 will not be suitable for the curve of the 128-bit security level.
As curves of 128-bit security level are currently the most widely used, we recommend both BLS12-381 and BN462 in this memo in order to have a more efficient and a more prudent option respectively.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>The recommended pairing-friendly curves are selected by considering the exTNFS proposed by Kim et al. in 2016 <xref target="KB16" format="default"/> and they are categorized in each security level in accordance with <xref target="BD18" format="default"/>.
Implementers who will newly develop pairing-based cryptography applications SHOULD use the recommended parameters.
As of 2020, as far as we know, there are no fatal attacks that significantly reduce the security of pairing-friendly curves after exTNFS.
</t>
      <t>BLS curves of embedding degree 12 typically require a characteristic p of 461 bits or larger to achieve the 128-bit security level <xref target="BD18" format="default"/>.
Note that the security level of BLS12-381, which is adopted by a lot of libraries and applications, is slightly below 128 bits because a 381-bit characteristic is used <xref target="BD18" format="default"/> <xref target="GMT19" format="default"/>.
</t>
      <t> BN254 is used in most of the existing implementations as shown in <xref target="adoption" format="default"/>, however, BN curves that were estimated as the 128-bit security level before exTNFS including BN254 ensure no more than the 100-bit security level by the effect of exTNFS.
 Implementers MAY use pairing-friendly curves with 100-bit security only if they need to keep interoperability with the existing applications.
</t>      
<t>In addition, implementors should be aware of the following points when they implement pairing-based cryptographic applications using recommended curves.</t>
<t>In applications such as key agreement protocols, users exchange the elements in G_1 and G_2 as public keys. To check these elements are so-called sub-group secure <xref target="BCM15" format="default"/>, implementors should validate if the elements have the correct order r. Specifically, for public keys P in G_1 and Q in G_2, a receiver should calculate scalar multiplications [r]P and [r]Q, and check the results become points at infinity.
</t>
<t>The pairing-based protocols, such as the BLS signatures, calculate a scalar multiplication with the secret key. In order to prevent the leakage of secret key due to side channel attacks, implementors should apply countermeasure techniques such as montgomery ladder when they implement a module of scalar multiplication<xref target="Montgomery" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC7748" format="default"/>.
</t>
<t>
When converting between an element in extension field and an octet string, implementors should check that the coefficient is within an appropriate range <xref target="IEEE1363" format="default"/>.
If the coefficient is out of range, there is a possible that security vulnerabilities such as the signature forgery may occur.
</t>
<t>
Recommended parameters are affected by the Cheon's attack which is a solving algorithm for the strong DH problem <xref target="Cheon06" format="default"/>. Therefore, implementers should be careful when they design cryptographic protocols based on the strong DH problem. For example, in the case of Short Signatures, they can prevent the Cheon's attack by carefully setting the maximum number of queries.

satisfying the properties shown in <xref target="pairing" format="default"/>, 
we give the subfunctions used for the pairing computation.</t>
      <t>The following algorithm, Line_Function shows the computation of the line function.
It takes A = (A[1], A[2]), B = (B[1], B[2]) in G_2, and P = ((P[1], P[2])) in G_1 as input, and outputs an element of G_T.</t>
      <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[
    if (A = B) then
        l := (3 * A[1]^2) / (2 * A[2]);
    else if (A = -B) then
        return P[1] - A[1];
    else
        l := (B[2] - A[2]) / (B[1] - A[1]);
    end if;
    return (l * (P[1] -A[1]) + A[2] -P[2]);
]]></artwork>
      <t>When implementing the line function, implementers should consider the isomorphism of E and its twist curve E' so that one can reduce the computational cost of operations in G_2. We note that Line_function does not consider such an isomorphism.</t>
      <t>The computation of the optimal Ate pairing for BN curves uses the Frobenius map.
The p-power Frobenius map pi for a point Q = (x, y) over E' is pi(p, Q) = (x^p, y^p).</t>

      <name>ZCash serialization format for BLS12-381</name>
<t>
This section describes the serialization format defined by <xref target="ZCashRep" format="default"/>.
This format applies to points on the BLS12-381 elliptic curves E and E',
whose parameters are given in <xref target="parameter-BLS12-381" format="default"/>.
</t>
<t>
At a high level, the serialization format is defined as follows:
</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
           <li>Serialized points include three metadata bits that indicate
  whether a point is compressed or not, whether a point is the point at
  infinity or not, and (for compressed points) the sign of the point's
  y-coordinate.
            </li>
            <li>Points on E are serialized into 48 bytes (compressed) or 96 bytes (uncompressed). Points on E' are serialized into 96 bytes (compressed) or 192 bytes (uncompressed).</li>
            <li>The serialization of a point at infinity comprises a string of zero bytes, except that the metadata bits may be nonzero.
            </li>
            <li>The serialization of a compressed point other than the point at infinity comprises a serialized x-coordinate.
            </li>
            <li>The serialization of an uncompressed point other than the point at infinity comprises a serialized x-coordinate followed by a serialized y-coordinate.
            </li>
           </ul>
<t>
Below, we give detailed serialization and de-serialization procedures.
The following notation is used in the rest of this section:
</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Elements of F_p^2 are represented as polynomial with F_p coefficients like <xref target="representation-convention-for-an-extension-field" format="default"/>.
          </li>
          <li> For a byte string str, str[0] is defined as the first byte of str.
          </li>
          <li>The function sign_F_p(y) returns one bit representing the sign of an
  element of F_p. This function is defined as follows:

    <li>
        If P is a point on E other than the point at infinity, then x is an
      element of F_p, i.e., an integer in the inclusive range [0, p - 1].
      In this case, let x_string = I2OSP(x, 48).
      </li>

      <li>
    If P is the point at infinity on E', let x_string = I2OSP(0, 96).

      represented as (x_0, x_1) where x_0 and x_1 are elements of F_p,
      i.e., integers in the inclusive range [0, p - 1] (see discussion of
      vector representations above).
      In this case, let x_string = I2OSP(x_1, 48) || I2OSP(x_0, 48).
     </li>
</ul>
<t>
    Notice that in all of the above cases, the 3 most significant bits of
    x_string[0] are guaranteed to be 0.
</t>
</li>

<li>
<t>
If point compression is used, let y_string be the empty string.

Let s_string = x_string || y_string.

<li>

Set s_string[0] = x_string[0] OR m_byte, where OR is computed bitwise.
   After this operation, the most significant bit of s_string[0] equals
   C_bit, the next bit equals I_bit, and the next equals S_bit.
   (This is true because the three most significant bits of x_string[0]
