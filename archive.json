I understand the necessity of including curves with less than 128-bit secuity, for easy reference to see that they are not secure, but including curves for which the security is unknown seems unnecessary.",

The exact complexity of [BD18]'s attack depends on the specific polynomial used to construct the family and can change the complexity of the attack by up to about 12 bits. The proposed construction of BLS12_381 you refer to here has been specially chosen to minimize the impact of the exTNFS attack. It would in my opinion be more precise to say:\r\n'We have to note that the security level of this pairing is expected to be 126 rather than 128 bits [GMT19]'.",

Why not define everything in terms of a prime field GF(p) and extension field GF(p^t), with fixed irreducible polynomial f(z) of degree t over GF(p)? This has been successfully used with elliptic curve specifications (NIST, ISO, ANSI, BSI) not tailored to pairing based crypto. This would also avoids questions that now immediately come up (such as whether defining GF(p^{d'}) in terms of GF(p^{d}) and \"inductively applying the above convention\" does yield an unambigous definition. Since all finite fields of fixed size are isomorphic, it would be much easier to stick to the standard way of doing this. This would also avoid messy tower of extension field arguments and messy representations of elements hereof (e.g., in Section 4.4). See also Appendix J on data conversions of the lwig draft referenced in this draft. As final note, the data conversions in that lwig draft require specifying bit/octet encodings (which, in the pairing case, seem to be most-significant-byte-first (MSB) and most-significant-bit-first (msb).\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments.\r\nYour proposed extension field seems to be simple, but there are many different ways to construct an extension field GF(p^12).\r\nSince BN254 with the embedding degree 12 was a major parameter, efficient construction methods for GF(p^12) have been researched.\r\n\r\nFrom the viewpoint of practical use, we adopted the construction method with (Fp-Fp2-Fp6-Fp12) using tower fields , which has also been used in implementations such as mcl library.\r\nIn addition, we use MSB-first (the big-endian encoding), so we've written that.",

This is a CFRG document, so one would expect something that provides insight, rather than simply a bombardment of tables, some selection criteria, and a filtered list.

Why suddenly squeeze in a point validation routine if no context is given at all of where and how pairing based crypto is used? Wit point validation, what if an octet representation is outside GF(p) boundary? (while the forelast para seems to imply an attack one is completely left in the dark what is at stake here). Not sure whether it is the role of CFRG documents to legitimize \"BN254 use ... to keep interoperability\". The end of the first para (\"as of 2020, as far as we know, there are no fatal attacks that significantly reduce the security of pairing-friendly curves after exTNFS\") is entirely non-reassuring to me: it is only four years after the DLP attack that necessitated to strike out half of the entries in the table earlier on in the paper, not that many people work on pairing-based algorithmic cryptanalysis in the first place, etc., etc. Where does this confidence come from (shouldn't one be more modest here, technically speaking???). The Cheon attack is not explained and cannot be evaluated at all, since no context on elliptic arithmetic is given at all in the draft.\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments!\r\nThere are multiple items in the comment, and we will answer below.\r\n\r\n- Regarding the comments related to the draft type \"experimental\", please be assured that we will discuss the change to \"informational\" with the CFRG chairs.\r\n\r\n- The application of pairing is shown in Section 1, so we have added a citation of Section 1.\r\n\r\n- As you pointed out, the description allowing the use of BN254 is inappropriate as an IRTF draft, so we have removed that statement.\r\n\r\n- As for attacks outside GF(P) boundary of the octet string, there are fears of the signature forgery.\r\n\r\n- Since you concerned about the description of \"as far as we know...\", we revised it more properly.\r\nWe write our draft based on the investigation result of the conference papers, so we revised it as \"as far as we've investigated the top cryptographic conferences in the past...\".\r\n\r\n- We added the explanation of the Cheon algorithm.\r\n",

Why refer to RFC 7748: whereas pairing-friendly curves are all Weierstrass curves, the curves in RFC 7748 are all Montgomery curves with completely different underlying detail on differential-addition chains). It seems that an entire section should be devoted to how implementations coul avoid SCA attacks, esp. since some operations take place in huge extension fields GF(p^t)...\r\n\r\nThanking for pointing that out!\r\nThanks to your point,  we found that the readers may not immediately understand by RFC 7748 that the montgomery ladder can be applied to Weierstrass curves.\r\nSo we decided to refer to another reference that specifies the detailed algorithm of montgomery ladder.",

This being said, technically that representation is a tiny tweak of what the SECG1 specification already stipulated in 2001 (with SEC1, one can extract the affine/compressed encoding of an affine point and whether this relates to the point at infinity from the leftmost octet (0x04, 0x02 or 0x03, vs. 0x00), which more or less 1-1 corresponds to the (C_bit, I_bit, S_bit) combinations. If so, reinventing yet another representation is hard to defend.\r\n\r\n>22) The parity bit notation for finite fields is highly non-standard, compared to, e.g., what has been standard usage with compressed points for curves over prime fields or binary extension fields. Even if this would have some uses, why not defining things once and for all for all extension fields of an odd prime field, so that this is a simple extension. See also Appendix H of [1] (parity function for any field GF(p^k), where p odd). This should also help in limiting side channel leakage from the first-half vs. last-half of [0,p-1] test.\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments!\r\nWe do not wish to propose the ZCash representation as a new convention in our draft.\r\nOur motivation is to describe the ZCash representation as a reference to implementers because it is the data convention that has been adopted by many BLS signature implementations.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to avoid any misunderstanding to the reader, we have clearly written that ZCash representation is a tiny tweak of SEC1 representation.\r\nIn addition, for your reference, we would like to mention that the parity bit representation is not entirely non-standard, as it is proposed in the IEEE document.\r\nIEEE Std 1363a-2004 gives serialization and deserialization procedures for curves over GF(p^m), and the ZCash spec is also very roughly similar to those.\r\n",

      "body": "- Intro and abstract: Too much attack details \u2014 omit entirely and refer reader to the paper, noting implications. Maybe merge with section 3?\r\n- Preliminaries: Are all details for curves necessary? Example: point at infinity, twists, etc?\r\n- Section 4: choosing \u201cwidely used\u201d over \u201cefficiency\u201d is interesting, as it may impede use cases that would consider adopting pairings but don\u2019t due to the cost. How would some of the recommendations change if \u201cefficiency\u201d were prioritized over \u201cwidely used\u201d? (Would BLS12-381 still stand on top?)\r\n- Section 4: 192-bit security is mentioned into the intro, but there is no matching recommendation. Recommend removing from intro. \r\n- Section 4: move adoption status to an appendix?\r\n- Section 4: link to application table points to a blog post. Consider removing?\r\n- Section 4.1.2: lots of libraries mentioned here \u2014 do any of them have formally verified implementations? Adding new curve support to a library is a tall order, but easier if, say, that code can be generated and formally verified.\r\n- Section 4.2: 128-bit security level: interesting that we\u2019re recommending things with less than 128 bits of security. At what rate does the security of this curve deteriorate? Generally: unclear if the CFRG has or will ever draw the line somewhere beneath this bound. \r\n- Section 4.2: Unclear what the security level of BN462 is \u2014 is it 128 bits?\r\n- Reference to I-D.ietf-lwig-curve-representations is unclear. What is the status of that draft?\r\n- Generally: parameters for curves are provided, but there\u2019s no safe implementable pairing specification. (The appendix code is not constant time, it seems. Is that important?) Unclear what the target audience is for. If this is for implementers deciding how to implement one of these curves, would they not need to know the corresponding pairing details? If it\u2019s for applications choosing curves, do they need to know all these curve details? (Same goes for encoding and decoding, which has some text in the security considerations section and then has one serialization format for BLS12_381. What about other curves? Do we want to recommend one serialization format so things are interoperable? Should the serialization format be something that applications decide?)\r\n- Appendix D: can this be dropped? ",

      "body": "Hello Yumi Sakemi, Tetsutaro Kobayashi, Tsunekazu Saito and Riad S. Wahby,\r\n\r\nI'd like to propose to add BLS12-377 - a pairing friendly curve gaining adoption in the last year.\r\n\r\nBLS12-377 has been introduced in the [Zexe paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/962.pdf), for the case where both the scalar and the base fields have high 2-adicity. This makes BLS12-377 efficient for creating SNARK over and for creating SNARKs with statement involving BLS12-377 operations.\r\n\r\nThese properties made it highly interesting for a few projects, some of which are running in production - [Celo](https://celo.org), [EY Nightfall](https://github.com/EYBlockchain/nightfall) among others.\r\n\r\nHaving it standardized would be beneficial for all the projects involved.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think and what could be done to improve it!",
